Coderbyte code challenge: username validation

There are 4 validation rules:
1. The username is between 4 and 25 characters.
2. The username must start with a letter.
3. The username can only contain letters, numbers, and the underscore character.
4. The username cannot end with an underscore character.

A supporting functions exists for each validation rule.  The CodelandUsernameValidation function calls each rule function and returns 
the appropriate resultant string.
